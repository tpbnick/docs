Hi, my name is Nick Platt.  I am currently a technical writer for Boeing Intelligence & Analytics and work with multiple development teams.  I recently graduated from the University of Maryland with a Bachelor's in Computer Networking and Cybersecurity.  I plan on obtaining a Master's in Software Engineering in the near future.  I have basic knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Markdown, and C (hopefully more to come in the near future).  If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me through the contact info below.
