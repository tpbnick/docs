You are able to customize Google Chrome on both your desktop and mobile applications by adding extensions from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions).

The Chrome Web Store allows users to install both extensions and themes to your browser!  Browser extensions are small pieces of software that are specifically designed to run within your web browser and run additional code.  This can include custom scripts, user interface modifications, ad blocking, cookie management, privacy enhancers, password managers, and many, many more.  

## Installing Extensions to the Chrome Browser

Installing extensions is as simple as a few clicks:

1. Open the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions).    

2. Click on the "Extensions" tab found below the "Search the store" box.  Browse the store and find the extension you want to add to your browser.  

3.  Click the **Add to Chrome** button.

4. The extension should now either be added to your browser or ask for approval if the extension requires additional permissions. **Make sure you only approve extensions that you trust.**  

5.  The extension will now be accessible to the right of the main address bar at the top of your browser.  If your extension is not visible, you can access the extensions page by clicking on the three dots ![threedots](https://cdn.nickplatt.dev/files/Docs/threedots.png) > More tools > Extensions or by putting `chrome://extensions/` in the top address bar.

Most extensions will require additional setup before you see the results you are expecting.  You can manage the extension by clicking on the extension and changing options within the GUI.  You are also able to manage extensions in the `chrome://extensions/` area.

Customizing the look of your browser has never been easier.  Google Chrome themes can be found in the same [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions) mentioned above.
