# What is Google Chrome?

## **Google Chrome Overview**

Google Chrome is a cross-platform web browser developed by Google. Chrome is a fast, simple, and secure browser for all your devices. As of April 2020, StatCounter estimates that Chrome has a 68% worldwide browser market share (after peaking at 72.36%) on traditional PCs and 64% across all platforms. Chrome allows its users to customize and control their user experience to a degree most other browsers don't, and this is largely thanks to Chrome extensions. While on the surface, Chrome might seem a simple browser, once you customize it with extensions it can be a tool that's both powerful and easy to use.

Google Chrome offers some amazing features, including:  

* **Speed** - Chrome’s address bar uses Google Search to make any fact-finding mission fast and simple. It also searches your Google Drive, so diving into next week’s vacation plan is just that much easier.
* **Simplicity** - Chrome is a clean and simple browser. The omnibox and multi tabbed browsing make navigating the web a breeze. When you close chrome, it will remember the tabs you had open so you can pick up right where you left off.
* **Security/Privacy** - Chrome provides build-in malware and phishing protection. Automatic updates keep your browser up-to-date and resilient against online threats. Chrome also lets you keep control of your private information while you browse online. Incognito mode is also included, which allows you to browse without saving your history, cookies, or downloads.
* **Customization** - Chrome boasts a large and robust web store that includes thousands of applications, themes, and extensions. Changing the theme of your browser allows you to tweak it to your liking. Extensions can make webpages more responsive to your needs!
Integration with Google Suite - Chrome offers the ability to sign into your Google account, which automatically syncs across your laptop, tablet, or on your phone. You get the same experience – no matter where you go! Anything you update on one device will instantly update everywhere else you sign in to Chrome brower.
