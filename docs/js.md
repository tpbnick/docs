## Introduction  
JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.  JavaScript is often the third component of modern websites, with HTML and CSS being the other two.  

JavaScript is not directly linked to the Java programming language, it was named JavaScript to appeal to the Java programmers of the time.  There are some superficial resemblances between JavaScript's code and Java code. Those similarities don't particularly come from shared development, but from both languages targeting developers with assumed syntax expectations from C (and to an extent, C++).

For example, we use the `{` to begin a block of code and the `}` to end that block of code, just like C/C++ and Java. We also use the `;` to punctuate the end of a statement.
