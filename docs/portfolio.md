## Portfolio

-   [**TriviaDart**](https://triviadart.com) - TriviaDart is a simple Trivia web
    application that utilizes both the Open Trivia DB and The Trivia API, which
    both offer generous free API usage. TriviaDart also has an in-house API that
    has over 45,000 trivia questions. Currently, there are no options available
    for these questions, but this will be added in the future. The in-house API
    utilizes Supabase.

-   [**Soccerfront.io**](https://soccerfront.io) - Soccerfront is a soccer live
    score web application built using Nodejs, ExpressJS, HTML, CSS, and
    JavaScript. Soccerfront pulls data from the API-FOOTBALL API and displays
    the information in an easy-to-use live score table and league table
    (standings) view. Currently, over 20 leagues/cups are supported! This is an
    ongoing project and new features will be added sporadically. Hosted on a
    DigitalOcean droplet running Linux and NGINX.

-   [**Personal Documentation Website**](https://docs.nicklyss.com) - A fully
    searchable and robust documentation site built using Material for MKDocs and
    written in Markdown. Multiple additional JavaScript modules, such as an
    image light gallery and scroll-to-top button added. Created to help
    facilitate personal learning and retain all information from books and
    classes attended. Hosted on a DigitalOcean droplet running Linux and Apache.
    You are on this site now!

-   [**Installation Guide Example - Firefox (2018)**](https://cdn.nickplatt.dev/files/Misc/Firefox%20Instructional%20Guide%20-%20Nick%20Platt.pdf)
    The goal of this guide is to inform a user to properly download, install,
    setup, and personalize Mozilla Firefox. This guide includes an overview of
    Mozilla Firefox, a how-to for proper setup, general use instructions, and
    personalization run through. Screenshots are also included to aid the user
    for ease of reading. This document was created in a technical writing class
    I took at University of Maryland Global Campus in 2018.
