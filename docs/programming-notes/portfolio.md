## Portfolio

- [**TriviaDart**](https://triviadart.com) - TriviaDart is a simple Trivia web
  application that utilizes both the Open Trivia DB and The Trivia API, which
  both offer generous free API usage. TriviaDart also has an in-house API that
  has over 45,000 trivia questions. Currently, there are no options available
  for these questions, but this will be added in the future. The in-house API
  utilizes Supabase.

- [**Soccerfront.io**](https://soccerfront.io) (Note: this has been retired/only the code remains) - Soccerfront is a soccer live
  score web application built using Nodejs, ExpressJS, HTML, CSS, and
  JavaScript. Soccerfront pulls data from the API-FOOTBALL API and displays the
  information in an easy-to-use live score table and league table (standings)
  view. Currently, over 20 leagues/cups are supported! This is an ongoing
  project and new features will be added sporadically. Hosted on a DigitalOcean
  droplet running Linux and NGINX.

- [**Personal Documentation Website**](https://docs.nicklyss.com) - A fully
  searchable and robust documentation site built using Material for MKDocs and
  written in Markdown. Multiple additional JavaScript modules, such as an image
  light gallery and scroll-to-top button added. Created to help facilitate
  personal learning and retain all information from books and classes attended.
  Hosted on a DigitalOcean droplet running Linux and Apache. You are on this
  site now!

- [**Installation Guide Example - Firefox (2018)**](https://cdn.nickplatt.dev/Misc/Firefox%20Instructional%20Guide%20-%20Nick%20Platt.pdf)
  The goal of this guide is to inform a user to properly download, install,
  setup, and personalize Mozilla Firefox. This guide includes an overview of
  Mozilla Firefox, a how-to for proper setup, general use instructions, and
  personalization run through. Screenshots are also included to aid the user for
  ease of reading. This document was created in a technical writing class I took
  at University of Maryland Global Campus in 2018.
