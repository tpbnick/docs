# REST vs. SOAP Web Services

## REST Explained

The struggle to achieve the concept of remote application programming interfaces (APIs) was very real.  The biggest problem was that there was no standard that everyone loved.  Overtime, a clear winner came forward that offered a clean and universally-accepted format, Representational State Transfer (REST).  REST is an architectural style that dictates standards for communication between computer systems on the web.  

???+ tip
	When APIs embrace the styles and constraints of REST, they are said to be RESTful.

REST has guiding architectural constraints for an API to be considered RESTful:

* Client-Server Architecture  

* Statelessness  

* Layered System  

* Cacheability  

* Uniform Design  

* Code on Demand
