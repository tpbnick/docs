I was also in the Marine Corps as an ELINT/All Source Analyst! I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Networking and Cybersecurity in 2020 and my Master's in Software Engineering in 2023, both from the University of Maryland. I enjoy frontend development, especially working with JavaScript and web application frameworks. If you have any questions, please ask!</p> <p>Creating robust and easy-to-understand documentation is what I do best. While teaching myself to program, along with my daily work as a technical writer, I have learned how important well written documentation is! Being able to convey a message to a wide-range of people is more difficult than you would think. Making sure you are writing at a level and tone that makes it so the most basic users can understand, while not insulting the advanced users' intelligence, can be quite the challenge.

It is a contract of sorts: it defines how it is expected to be used and what you can expect to receive by using it.</p> <p>When most people hear the acronym API, they most likely are thinking about web-based APIs, which is completely understandable. You must also know about the many APIs that are built into all modern programming languages. For example, let's say you wanted to capitalize a string of text. We could write a long code to translate each individual letter to the uppercase version through low level bitmath OR we could use the uppercase API:</p> <p>Python</p> <pre><code>'yeet!'.upper() # YEET!\n</code></pre> <p>JavaScript</p> <pre><code>\"yeet!\".toUpperCase(); // YEET!\n</code></pre> <p>Java</p> <pre><code>\"yeet!\".toUpperCase(); // YEET!\n</code></pre> <p>Basically, programmers use APIs to avoid recreating the wheel. APIs assist us in accomplishing tasks that we need to perform, by abstracting away a ton of work for us.</p>"},{"location":"api/#remote-apis","title":"Remote APIs","text":"<p>The above examples we gave were local APIs, built into the programming language. Remote APIs can be looked at similarly to your TV's remote. You work with the interface on the remote to make changes to the TV, as if you were using the interface on the device itself.</p> <p>Its not just physical objects that benefit from remote APIs. Sometimes, we don't have space on our local machines for all the data that is available. For example, when we use an app like Shazam to find out what song is playing, the app doesn't store ALL the songs in the world on your phone; it instead uses a remote API to send data to the app serice for indentification.</p> <p>Remote APIs also offer another benefit of computational power. Because an API removes the limitations of your local machine, you can gain access to huge amounts of computational power. A good example of this is the AR feature in the Google Translate app. The app allows you to use the camera on your phone to translate what you are seeing directly to your screen in near real-time. This app requires a ton of computational power and it is getting it elsewhere (through cloud computing).</p>"},{"location":"api/#rest-representational-state-transfer","title":"REST (REpresentational State Transfer)","text":"<p>The struggle to achieve the concept of remote APIs was very real. The biggest problem was that there was no standard that everyone loved. Overtime, a clear winner came forward that offered a clean and universally-accepted format, REST. The popularity of REST spread so rapidly that it nearly took over the word API (think how XEROX almost took over the term photocopy). REST is not the end-all, be-all of remote APIs, but it is one of the most common and documented solution. The following notes will cover the REST framework!</p> <p>!!! tip \"RESTful\" When APIs embrace the styles and constraints of REST, they are said to be RESTful.</p> <p>Here are the guiding architectural constraints for an API to be considered RESTful:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Client-Server Architecture</p> </li> <li> <p>Statelessness</p> </li> <li> <p>Layered System</p> </li> <li> <p>Cacheability</p> </li> <li> <p>Uniform Design</p> </li> <li> <p>Code on Demand</p> </li> </ul> <p>Let's cover these topics by discussing how APIs sit on top of web technology. Much like the web, the client (web browser/program) makes a request to a server. Your program will most likely be using some type of library to create the request to the server. The protocol used for these requests are through HTTP and it is stateless (the server won't remember anything about the particular client (state can be maintained through headers)).</p> <p>This request was almost certainly requesting information about a resource. The \"resource\" is a little absract, it is the R in URL or URI. We use the term resource to reference an object, which is also abstract. This is because we can use resources to describe just about anything we build. For example, let's imagine an e-book store website. Each book available for purchase is a resource. If we click into it, we may see a link to the author, which is also a resource. When we click on a resource the browser sends a GET request to the server. The RESTful API follows the same logic; your program will send a GET request to a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), then the server responds with data. The body of the data returned is typically represented today as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). JSON provides a great way to structure and nest the data.</p> <p>Here are a few HTTP verbs that are used in REST APIs to clearly state the intention of your request:</p> HTTP Verbs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) GET Read POST Create PUT Update PATCH Update DELETE Delete <p>Want to add an author? POST to the /authors and send them the data you want to update in the body of your request:</p> <pre><code>POST /authors/{author_Name: \"Dave Eggers\"}\n</code></pre> <p>Want to remove an author? Send a DELETE to that specific author:</p> <pre><code>DELETE /authors/{HBWSG123}\n</code></pre> <p>This means that you can interact with any application out there that exposes their REST API.</p>"},{"location":"api/#exploring-an-api-online","title":"Exploring an API Online","text":"<p>Let's look at a real API online and see what we can learn. For this, we are going to be looking at Spotify's API. Here we can see all the different features that Spotify allows user's to use in their API. Let's go down to the Search section and read the documentation. We can click on the API beta link at the top and then look for the \"Search for an Item\" link. This documentation explains the \"contract\" of what we need to do in order to use the API.</p> <p>In this documentation we can see which type of headers and query parameters in the request are required or optional for the API to work. You can also see the types of reponses your request can receive. Reading the documentation for APIs is perhaps the most important step in implementing an API in your code. You will see notes from the programmers on how to actually make it work!</p> <p>Let's work with Spotify's Web Console, which allows us to test their APIs and play around with the different features. The Console will show us where it will query:</p> <pre><code>GET https://api.spotify.com/v1/search\n</code></pre> <p>and how it will query:</p> <pre><code>curl -X \"GET\" \"https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?q=Palace&amp;type=artist&amp;market=US&amp;limit=2\" -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer BQBBI2LYRwSAZ__Agy0GV0BU_i3adk4b4Wsv7eQbfsgdOJUn0HJDgCJpF3v6g_oJ6rcZjOeEdVVz4FrIKZWoAixqhEhJYtqByw0jQfC5ZMHq-wqJACdyrQ7sIQlpeZXemL2jGhfa728ckA9\"\n</code></pre> <p>If we break down the above API GET request, we can see that we are searching for <code>?q=Palace&amp;type=artist</code> along with some other bits.

You can also see the Bearer OAuth token at the end, which I have changed in order for my account to remain anonymous.</p> <p>If we run this in the Console, we will get a result that looks something like the following:</p> <pre><code>{\n\"artists\": {\n\"href\": \"https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?query=Palace&amp;type=artist&amp;market=US&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=2\",\n\"items\": [\n{\n\"external_urls\": {\n\"spotify\": \"https://open.spotify.com/artist/48vDIufGC8ujPuBiTxY8dm\"\n},\n\"followers\": {\n\"href\": null,\n\"total\": 107224\n},\n\"genres\": [\"english indie rock\", \"indie soul\", \"vapor soul\"],\n\"href\": \"https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists/48vDIufGC8ujPuBiTxY8dm\",\n\"id\": \"48vDIufGC8ujPuBiTxY8dm\",\n\"images\": [\n{\n\"height\": 640,\n\"url\": \"https://i.scdn.co/image/8b76736404ceb4bc72669f44908dea557ab03083\",\n\"width\": 640\n},\n{\n\"height\": 320,\n\"url\": \"https://i.scdn.co/image/0c135b9e55b911a37b7aee00af60630c777d4c04\",\n\"width\": 320\n},\n{\n\"height\": 160,\n\"url\": \"https://i.scdn.co/image/79c30a9ba1518749fb74cc449bcaa060f8aa8151\",\n\"width\": 160\n}\n],\n\"name\": \"Palace\",\n\"popularity\": 59,\n\"type\": \"artist\",\n\"uri\": \"spotify:artist:48vDIufGC8ujPuBiTxY8dm\"\n},\n{\n\"external_urls\": {\n\"spotify\": \"https://open.spotify.com/artist/37J1PlAkhRK7yrZUtqaUpQ\"\n},\n\"followers\": {\n\"href\": null,\n\"total\": 716429\n},\n\"genres\": [\"electro swing\", \"nu jazz\"],\n\"href\": \"https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists/37J1PlAkhRK7yrZUtqaUpQ\",\n\"id\": \"37J1PlAkhRK7yrZUtqaUpQ\",\n\"images\": [\n{\n\"height\": 640,\n\"url\": \"https://i.scdn.co/image/adc8c619e766119fabd784a257d6376a653d41ea\",\n\"width\": 640\n},\n{\n\"height\": 320,\n\"url\": \"https://i.scdn.co/image/65df61829bfdb02f7e068de1b3c28799bdc5ace6\",\n\"width\": 320\n},\n{\n\"height\": 160,\n\"url\": \"https://i.scdn.co/image/e86351da17029aa21616d98104bbc6f3c61109d7\",\n\"width\": 160\n}\n],\n\"name\": \"Caravan Palace\",\n\"popularity\": 67,\n\"type\": \"artist\",\n\"uri\": \"spotify:artist:37J1PlAkhRK7yrZUtqaUpQ\"\n}\n],\n\"limit\": 2,\n\"next\": \"https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?query=Palace&amp;type=artist&amp;market=US&amp;offset=2&amp;limit=2\",\n\"offset\": 0,\n\"previous\": null,\n\"total\": 448\n}\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Above you can see the response from the Search API of Spotify.

SDKs are unique to each programming language and help make your code more concise and legible.</p> <p>We are going to start out by working with Node. Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. After installing Node, we can open a command prompt and type in the command <code>node -v</code> to check what version of Node is loaded. If an error occurs, Node is not installed properly on your machine. First, let's create a new directory to work inside with the <code>mkdir scratch</code> command. In that directory let's make a directory called <code>javascript</code> with the <code>mkdir javascript</code> command. Lets open this folder in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and create a new file called <code>explore.js</code> in the javascript folder.</p> <p>Let's open the terminal in VS Code and install the twilio library with the following command:</p> <pre><code>npm install twilio\n</code></pre> <p>Now that we have downloaded the file, let's write some code in the <code>explore.js</code> file we made earlier:</p> <pre><code>const Twilio = require(\"twilio\");\n\nconst client = new Twilio(\n\"AC504e58232220f1698dbf3c55a8ff73jm\",\n\"261209ecabd9de3cec413a4b458a423za\",\n);\n</code></pre> <p>The two variables we using in the string are are account SID and Auth Token. The problem with this is whenever we upload or share this with anyone, our account credentials are right there to be seen. Later, we will put these into environment variables, but for now, we will stick with this for ease of demonstration.</p> <p>The Twilio JS Client works like most JavaScript libraries. It is asynchronous, and it relies on a concept called promises. The way promises work is that there are set handlers for when a method call completes. To get our message log, we would use the following method (line 5):</p> <pre><code>const Twilio = require(\"twilio\");\n\nconst client = new Twilio(\n\"AC504e58232220f1698dbf3c55a8ff73jm\",\n\"261209ecabd9de3cec413a4b458a423za\",\n);\n\nclient.messages.list();\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>client.messages.list()</code> method returns an object called a promise. It is a promise of a future value, which in this case will be our messages. Promises have an important method on them, and it's called then. We can chain on a <code>.then</code> to the end of the method (this method should also be given a function that accepts a value).</p> <p>To pass <code>messages</code> a function, we use something called a fat arrow function (see below). In the <code>.then</code> method, we will put the name of the value (<code>messages</code>), because this is what we are expecting to return. Next we are going to put a fat arrow <code>=&gt;</code>, followed by the function body.</p> Fat Arrow Functions <p>\"Fat arrow functions\" are a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. They utilize a new token, <code>=&gt;</code>, that looks like a fat arrow. Arrow functions are anonymous and change the way <code>this</code> binds in functions. By using arrow functions, we avoid having to type the <code>function</code> keyword, <code>return</code> keyword (it\u2019s implicit in arrow functions), and curly brackets.</p> <p>Let's simply log out the most recent message.

What happens, for instance, in an election with three candidates, and the ballots below are cast?</p> Ballot Ballot Ballot Ballot Ballot Alice Alice Bob Bob Charlie <p>A plurality vote would here declare a tie between Alice and Bob, since each has two votes. But is that the right outcome?</p> <p>There\u2019s another kind of voting system known as a ranked-choice voting system. In a ranked-choice system, voters can vote for more than one candidate. Instead of just voting for their top choice, they can rank the candidates in order of preference. The resulting ballots might therefore look like the below.</p> Ballot Ballot Ballot Ballot Ballot 1.Alice 1.Alice 1.Bob 1.Bob 1.Charlie 2.Bob 2.Charlie 2.Alice 2.Alice 2.Alice 3.Charlie 3.Bob 3.Charlie 3.Charlie 3.Bob <p>Here, each voter, in addition to specifying their first preference candidate, has also indicated their second and third choices. And now, what was previously a tied election could now have a winner. The race was originally tied between Alice and Bob, so Charlie was out of the running. But the voter who chose Charlie preferred Alice over Bob, so Alice could here be declared the winner.</p> <p>One such ranked choice voting system is the instant runoff system. In an instant runoff election, voters can rank as many candidates as they wish. If any candidate has a majority (more than 50%) of the first preference votes, that candidate is declared the winner of the election.</p> <p>Let's look at the following code and see how we can implement this type of voting system.

White\u2019s \u201cCharlotte\u2019s Web\u201d is between a second and fourth grade reading level, and Lois Lowry\u2019s \u201cThe Giver\u201d is between an eighth grade reading level and a twelfth grade reading level. What does it mean, though, for a book to be at a \u201cfourth grade reading level\u201d?</p> <p>Well, in many cases, a human expert might read a book and make a decision on the grade for which they think the book is most appropriate. But you could also imagine an algorithm attempting to figure out what the reading level of a text is.</p> <p>So what sorts of traits are characteristic of higher reading levels? Well, longer words probably correlate with higher reading levels. Likewise, longer sentences probably correlate with higher reading levels, too. A number of \u201creadability tests\u201d have been developed over the years, to give a formulaic process for computing the reading level of a text.</p> <p>One such readability test is the Coleman-Liau index. The Coleman-Liau index of a text is designed to output what (U.S.) grade level is needed to understand the text. The formula is:</p> <pre><code>    index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8\n</code></pre> <p>Here, <code>L</code> is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text, and <code>S</code> is the average number of sentences per 100 words in the text.</p> <p>Let\u2019s write a program called <code>readability</code> that takes a text and determines its reading level. For example, if user types in a line from Dr. Seuss:</p> <pre><code>$ ./readability\nText: Congratulations! Today is your day. You're off to Great Places! You're off and away!\nGrade 3\n</code></pre> <p>The text the user inputted has 65 letters, 4 sentences, and 14 words. 65 letters per 14 words is an average of about 464.29 letters per 100 words. And 4 sentences per 14 words is an average of about 28.57 sentences per 100 words. Plugged into the Coleman-Liau formula, and rounded to the nearest whole number, we get an answer of 3: so this passage is at a third grade reading level.</p> <pre><code>$ ./readability\nText: Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another, he really wanted to do his homework, but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of the night. And he also happened to be a wizard.\nGrade 5\n</code></pre> <p>This text has 214 letters, 4 sentences, and 56 words. That comes out to about 382.14 letters per 100 words, and 7.14 sentences per 100 words. Plugged into the Coleman-Liau formula, we get a fifth grade reading level.</p> <p>As the average number of letters and words per sentence increases, the Coleman-Liau index gives the text a higher reading level. If you were to take this paragraph, for instance, which has longer words and sentences than either of the prior two examples, the formula would give the text an eleventh grade reading level.</p> <pre><code>$ ./readability\nText: As the average number of letters and words per sentence increases, the Coleman-Liau index gives the text a higher reading level. If you were to take this paragraph, for instance, which has longer words and sentences than either of the prior two examples, the formula would give the text an eleventh grade reading level.\nGrade 11\n</code></pre> <p>For this program we need to start with counting the letters, words, and sentences there are in the submitted text. Next, we will plug those results into the Coleman-Liau index, mentioned above, <code>index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8</code>. Finally, we will take the result from the Coleman-Liau index and display the correct (U.S.) grade level.</p> <p>Walkthrough</p> <p>First, we will look at the letters in the submitted text. We will need to count the number of both uppercase and lowercase letters in the text. We will also need to ignore the spaces and punctuation. We will need to look at each letter in the submitted text as it's own space as follows:</p> 1 2 3 4 5 - - 6 7 8 9 10 - H e l l o , w o l r d ! <p>We will utilize the library <code>#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;</code> to help differentiate characters from each other.</p> <p>We will then need to calculate the number of words in a sentence. We will do this by thinking that any sequence of characters separated by one or more spaces is a word. This would look as follows:</p> 1 2 H e l l o , w o l r d ! <p>Finally, we will look at sentences. For this problem, any period, exclamation point, or question mark will indicate a sentence. This may no be true in some instances (Mr. or Mrs.), but should work in most cases.</p> <p>After these steps, we should have an accurate count of <code>letters</code>, <code>words</code>, and <code>sentences</code>. We should then run these numbers through the Coleman-Liau index.</p> <p>The formula should give out a real number, but we should round to the nearest whole number (<code>int</code>). Output should be \"Grade #\", where # is the grade level.

Supposedly, Caesar (yes, that Caesar) used to \u201cencrypt\u201d (i.e., conceal in a reversible way) confidential messages by shifting each letter therein by some number of places. For instance, he might write A as B, B as C, C as D, \u2026, and, wrapping around alphabetically, Z as A. And so, to say HELLO to someone, Caesar might write IFMMP. Upon receiving such messages from Caesar, recipients would have to \u201cdecrypt\u201d them by shifting letters in the opposite direction by the same number of places.</p> <p>The secrecy of this \u201ccryptosystem\u201d relied on only Caesar and the recipients knowing a secret, the number of places by which Caesar had shifted his letters (e.g., 1). Not particularly secure by modern standards, but, hey, if you\u2019re perhaps the first in the world to do it, pretty secure!</p> <p>!!! note Unencrypted text is generally called plaintext. Encrypted text is generally called ciphertext. And the secret used is called a key.</p> <p>To be clear, then, here\u2019s how encrypting <code>HELLO</code> with a key of 1 yields <code>IFMMP</code>:</p> plaintext H E L L O + key 1 1 1 1 1 = ciphertext I F M M P <p>More formally, Caesar\u2019s algorithm (i.e., cipher) encrypts messages by \u201crotating\u201d each letter by k positions. More formally, if p is some plaintext (i.e., an unencrypted message), pi is the ith character in p, and k is a secret key (i.e., a non-negative integer), then each letter, ci, in the ciphertext, c, is computed as:</p> <p>ci = (pi + k) % 26</p> <p>wherein <code>% 26</code> here means \u201cremainder when dividing by 26.\u201d This formula perhaps makes the cipher seem more complicated than it is, but it\u2019s really just a concise way of expressing the algorithm precisely. Indeed, for the sake of discussion, think of A (or a) as 0, B (or b) as 1, \u2026, H (or h) as 7, I (or i) as 8, \u2026, and Z (or z) as 25. Suppose that Caesar just wants to say Hi to someone confidentially using, this time, a key, k, of 3. And so his plaintext, p, is Hi, in which case his plaintext\u2019s first character, p0, is H (aka 7), and his plaintext\u2019s second character, p1, is i (aka 8). His ciphertext\u2019s first character, c0, is thus K, and his ciphertext\u2019s second character, c1, is thus L. Can you see why?</p> <p>Here are a few examples of how the program might work. For example, if the user inputs a key of <code>1</code> and a plaintext of <code>HELLO</code>:</p> <pre><code>$ ./caesar 1\nplaintext:  HELLO\nciphertext: IFMMP\n</code></pre> <p>Here\u2019s how the program might work if the user provides a key of <code>13</code> and a plaintext of <code>hello, world</code>:</p> <pre><code>$ ./caesar 13\nplaintext:  hello, world\nciphertext: uryyb, jbeyq\n</code></pre> <p>Now let's get coding!</p> <p>We need our program to do the following:</p> <ul> <li>Get Key (the amount to shift the text by)</li> <li>Get plaintext</li> <li>Encipher</li> <li>Print ciphertext</li> </ul> <p>!!! note We will preserve case for letters (Keep capital letters capital, and lowercase lowercase). We will also wrap the alphabet (If we go beyond the boundaries of the alphabet, it will just start over).</p> <p>Let's walkthrough each piece of the program.</p> <p>Get the Key</p> <p>We will be taking the key as a command line argument:</p> <pre><code>$ ./caesar 3\n</code></pre> <p>Remember that in C our main function can take arguments using the following:</p> <pre><code>int main(int argc, string argv[])\n{\n// code here\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Getting the Key</p> <ul> <li>Ensure single command-line argument (print error message if command-line     argument is out of bounds)</li> <li>Make sure argument contains only digit characters</li> <li>Convert argument to an integer</li> </ul> <p>We will also need to convert the <code>string</code> from the command line argument into a number using the <code>atoi</code> function, declared in <code>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</code>.</p> <p>Getting the Plaintext</p> <p>We will simply use the <code>get_string</code> function to get user input for the plaintext.</p> <p>Encipher the Plaintext</p> <p>If it's alphabetic, shift the plaintext character by key, preserving the case.</p> <p>If it's not alphabetic, leave the character as-is.</p> <p>We can use the following functions to help us identify character type: <code>isalpha</code>, <code>isupper</code>, and <code>islower</code>.

How does that work?</p> <p>Recall that if the red, green, and blue values are all set to <code>0x00</code> (hexadecimal for <code>0</code>), then the pixel is black. And if all values are set to <code>0xff</code> (hexadecimal for <code>255</code>), then the pixel is white. So long as the red, green, and blue values are all equal, the result will be varying shades of gray along the black-white spectrum, with higher values meaning lighter shades (closer to white) and lower values meaning darker shades (closer to black).</p> <p>So to convert a pixel to grayscale, we just need to make sure the red, green, and blue values are all the same value. But how do we know what value to make them? Well, it\u2019s probably reasonable to expect that if the original red, green, and blue values were all pretty high, then the new value should also be pretty high. And if the original values were all low, then the new value should also be low.</p> <p>In fact, to ensure each pixel of the new image still has the same general brightness or darkness as the old image, we can take the average of the red, green, and blue values to determine what shade of grey to make the new pixel.</p> <p>If you apply that to each pixel in the image, the result will be an image converted to grayscale.</p> <p>Sepia</p> <p>Most image editing programs support a \u201csepia\u201d filter, which gives images an old-timey feel by making the whole image look a bit reddish-brown.</p> <p>An image can be converted to sepia by taking each pixel, and computing new red, green, and blue values based on the original values of the three.</p> <p>There are a number of algorithms for converting an image to sepia, but for this problem, we\u2019ll ask you to use the following algorithm. For each pixel, the sepia color values should be calculated based on the original color values per the below.</p> <pre><code>sepiaRed = .393 * originalRed + .769 * originalGreen + .189 * originalBlue\nsepiaGreen = .349 * originalRed + .686 * originalGreen + .168 * originalBlue\nsepiaBlue = .272 * originalRed + .534 * originalGreen + .131 * originalBlue\n</code></pre> <p>Of course, the result of each of these formulas may not be an integer, but each value could be rounded to the nearest integer. It\u2019s also possible that the result of the formula is a number greater than 255, the maximum value for an 8-bit color value. In that case, the red, green, and blue values should be capped at 255. As a result, we can guarantee that the resulting red, green, and blue values will be whole numbers between 0 and 255, inclusive.</p> <p>Reflection</p> <p>Some filters might also move pixels around. Reflecting an image, for example, is a filter where the resulting image is what you would get by placing the original image in front of a mirror. So any pixels on the left side of the image should end up on the right, and vice versa.</p> <p>Note that all of the original pixels of the original image will still be present in the reflected image, it\u2019s just that those pixels may have rearranged to be in a different place in the image.</p> <p>Blur</p> <p>There are a number of ways to create the effect of blurring or softening an image. For this problem, we\u2019ll use the \u201cbox blur,\u201d which works by taking each pixel and, for each color value, giving it a new value by averaging the color values of neighboring pixels.</p> <p>Consider the following grid of pixels, where we\u2019ve numbered each pixel.</p> <p></p> <p>The new value of each pixel would be the average of the values of all of the pixels that are within 1 row and column of the original pixel (forming a 3x3 box).

Likewise, the color values for pixel 11 would be be obtained by averaging the color values of pixels 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 and 16.</p> <p>For a pixel along the edge or corner, like pixel 15, we would still look for all pixels within 1 row and column: in this case, pixels 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, and 16.</p>"},{"location":"c-memory-problems/#problem-solving","title":"Problem Solving","text":"<p>Get the files for the filter HERE.</p> <p>Now let's look at the files provided to help break understand what is inside.</p> <p><code>bmp.h</code></p> <code>bmp.h</code> code <pre><code>// BMP-related data types based on Microsoft's own\n\n#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;\n\n/**\n    * Common Data Types\n    *\n    * The data types in this section are essentially aliases for C/C++\n    * primitive data types.\n    *\n    * Adapted from http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc230309.aspx.\n    * See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stdint.h for more on stdint.h.\n    */\ntypedef uint8_t  BYTE;\ntypedef uint32_t DWORD;\ntypedef int32_t  LONG;\ntypedef uint16_t WORD;\n\n/**\n    * BITMAPFILEHEADER\n    *\n    * The BITMAPFILEHEADER structure contains information about the type, size,\n    * and layout of a file that contains a DIB [device-independent bitmap].\n    *\n    * Adapted from http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd183374(VS.85).aspx.\n    */\ntypedef struct\n{\nWORD   bfType;\nDWORD  bfSize;\nWORD   bfReserved1;\nWORD   bfReserved2;\nDWORD  bfOffBits;\n} __attribute__((__packed__))\nBITMAPFILEHEADER;\n\n/**\n    * BITMAPINFOHEADER\n    *\n    * The BITMAPINFOHEADER structure contains information about the\n    * dimensions and color format of a DIB [device-independent bitmap].\n    *\n    * Adapted from http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd183376(VS.85).aspx.\n    */\ntypedef struct\n{\nDWORD  biSize;\nLONG   biWidth;\nLONG   biHeight;\nWORD   biPlanes;\nWORD   biBitCount;\nDWORD  biCompression;\nDWORD  biSizeImage;\nLONG   biXPelsPerMeter;\nLONG   biYPelsPerMeter;\nDWORD  biClrUsed;\nDWORD  biClrImportant;\n} __attribute__((__packed__))\nBITMAPINFOHEADER;\n\n/**\n    * RGBTRIPLE\n    *\n    * This structure describes a color consisting of relative intensities of\n    * red, green, and blue.\n    *\n    * Adapted from http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa922590.aspx.\n    */\ntypedef struct\n{\nBYTE  rgbtBlue;\nBYTE  rgbtGreen;\nBYTE  rgbtRed;\n} __attribute__((__packed__))\nRGBTRIPLE;\n</code></pre> <p>You\u2019ll see definitions of the headers we\u2019ve mentioned (<code>BITMAPINFOHEADER</code> and <code>BITMAPFILEHEADER</code>).

Thankfully, in the computer world, \u201cdeleted\u201d tends not to mean \u201cdeleted\u201d so much as \u201cforgotten.\u201d Even though the camera insists that the card is now blank, we\u2019re pretty sure that\u2019s not quite true.</p> <p>Even though JPEGs are more complicated than BMPs, JPEGs have \u201csignatures,\u201d patterns of bytes that can distinguish them from other file formats. Specifically, the first three bytes of JPEGs are:</p> <pre><code>0xff 0xd8 0xff\n</code></pre> <p>from first byte to third byte, left to right. The fourth byte, meanwhile, is either <code>0xe0</code>, <code>0xe1</code>, <code>0xe2</code>, <code>0xe3</code>, <code>0xe4</code>, <code>0xe5</code>, <code>0xe6</code>, <code>0xe7</code>, <code>0xe8</code>, <code>0xe9</code>, <code>0xea</code>, <code>0xeb</code>, <code>0xec</code>, <code>0xed</code>, <code>0xee</code>, or <code>0xef</code>. Put another way, the fourth byte\u2019s first four bits are <code>1110</code>.</p> <p>Odds are, if you find this pattern of four bytes on media known to store photos (e.g., my memory card), they demarcate the start of a JPEG. To be fair, you might encounter these patterns on some disk purely by chance, so data recovery isn\u2019t an exact science.</p> <p>Fortunately, digital cameras tend to store photographs contiguously on memory cards, whereby each photo is stored immediately after the previously taken photo. Accordingly, the start of a JPEG usually demarks the end of another. However, digital cameras often initialize cards with a FAT file system whose \u201cblock size\u201d is 512 bytes (B). The implication is that these cameras only write to those cards in units of 512 B. A photo that\u2019s 1 MB (i.e., 1,048,576 B) thus takes up 1048576 \u00f7 512 = 2048 \u201cblocks\u201d on a memory card. But so does a photo that\u2019s, say, one byte smaller (i.e., 1,048,575 B)! The wasted space on disk is called \u201cslack space.\u201d Forensic investigators often look at slack space for remnants of suspicious data.</p> <p>The implication of all these details is that you, the investigator, can probably write a program that iterates over a copy of my memory card, looking for JPEGs\u2019 signatures. Each time you find a signature, you can open a new file for writing and start filling that file with bytes from my memory card, closing that file only once you encounter another signature. Moreover, rather than read my memory card\u2019s bytes one at a time, you can read 512 of them at a time into a buffer for efficiency\u2019s sake. Thanks to FAT, you can trust that JPEGs\u2019 signatures will be \u201cblock-aligned.\u201d That is, you need only look for those signatures in a block\u2019s first four bytes.</p> <p>Realize, of course, that JPEGs can span contiguous blocks. Otherwise, no JPEG could be larger than 512 B. But the last byte of a JPEG might not fall at the very end of a block. Recall the possibility of slack space. But not to worry. Because this memory card was brand-new when I started snapping photos, odds are it\u2019d been \u201czeroed\u201d (i.e., filled with 0s) by the manufacturer, in which case any slack space will be filled with 0s. It\u2019s okay if those trailing 0s end up in the JPEGs you recover; they should still be viewable. Now, I only have one memory card, but there are a lot of you! And so I\u2019ve gone ahead and created a \u201cforensic image\u201d of the card, storing its contents, byte after byte, in a file called <code>card.raw</code>. So that you don\u2019t waste time iterating over millions of 0s unnecessarily, I\u2019ve only imaged the first few megabytes of the memory card. But you should ultimately find that the image contains 50 JPEGs.</p>"},{"location":"c-memory-problems/#problem-solving_1","title":"Problem Solving","text":"<p>Get the files for the recovery problem HERE.</p> <p>Let's take a look at the code provided in the .zip:</p> <p>??? example \"<code>recover.c</code> code\" ```c linenums=\"1\" #include  #include  <pre><code>int main(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n\n}\n```\n</code></pre> <p>The above code is basically bare of anything, which means we should break down what we need to do:</p> <p>Tasks</p> <ul> <li> <p>Open memory card</p> </li> <li> <p>Look for beginning of a JPEG</p> </li> <li> <p>Open a new JPEG file</p> </li> <li> <p>Write 512 bytes until a new JPEG is found</p> </li> <li> <p>Stop at the end of the file</p> </li> </ul> <p>Let's look at some things we can do for each step:</p> <p>Open memory card</p> <p>We can take advantage of the <code>fopen()</code> function to open the memory card:</p> <pre><code>FILE *f = fopen(filename, \"r\");\n</code></pre> <p>Here inside the <code>fopen();</code> the filename is the name of the file you are trying to open and the <code>\"r\"</code> means you want to read the files.</p> <p>Look for beginning of a JPEG</p> <p>As mentioned previously, each JPEG file starts with a distinct header, meaning that first byte is always <code>0xff</code>, the second byte is always <code>0xd8</code>, the third byte is always <code>0xff</code>, and the fourth byte can vary a little bit, but always start with <code>0xe</code>.</p> <p>Luckily for us, each JPEG is stored back-to-back in this problem file.</p> <p>We can utilize the <code>fread()</code> function to look for JPEGs.</p> <pre><code>fread(data, size, number, inptr);\n</code></pre> <p>The above code can be broken down as:</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>data</code>: pointer to where to store data you're reading.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>size</code>: size of each element to read.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>number</code>: number of elements to read.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>inptr</code>: <code>FILE *</code> to read from.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For example, we can check to see if the first byte of an array, for example called <code>buffer</code>, contains <code>0xff</code>:</p> <pre><code>buffer[0] == 0xff\nbuffer[1] == 0xd8\nbuffer[2] == 0xff\n</code></pre> <p><code>buffer[3]</code> is a little bit more confusing because it can vary.

For example, if we were to look at the hex number 0x397, it would be as follows:</p> 256 (162) 16 (161) 1 (160) 0x 3 9 7 <p>So the above number would be (3 x 256) + (9 x 16) + 7 = 919.</p> <p>Another example that uses alphanumeric hex characters:</p> 256 (162) 16 (161) 1 (160) 0x A D C <p>This would look like (10 x 256) + (13 x 16) + 12 = 2780 in decimal form.</p> <p>Here, the <code>F</code> is a value of 15 in decimal, and each place is a power of 16, so the first <code>F</code> is 16^1 _ 15 = 240, plus the second <code>F</code> with the value of 16^0 _ 15 = 15, for a total of 255.</p> <p>Here is a quick chart to compare decimal, hexadecimal, and binary:</p> <p></p> <p>The RGB color system also conventionally uses hexadecimal to describe the amount of each color. For example, <code>000000</code> in hexadecimal means 0 of each red, green, and blue, for a color of black. And <code>FF0000</code> would be 255, or the highest possible, amount of red. With different values for each color, we can represent millions of different colors.</p> <p>In writing, we can also indicate a value is in hexadecimal by prefixing it with <code>0x</code>, as in <code>0x10</code>, where the value is equal to 16 in decimal, as opposed to 10. <code>0x</code> means nothing to a computer, this is simply to help humans see when hexadecimal will be used.</p>"},{"location":"c-memory/#pointers","title":"Pointers","text":"<p>Pointers provide an alternative way to pass data between functions.</p> <ul> <li>Up until this point we have passed all data by value, which means we have     only passed a copy of that data.</li> </ul> <p>If we use pointers instead, we have the power to pass the actual variable itself.

The <code>*</code> operator lets us \"go to\" the location that a pointer is point to. For example, we can print <code>*&amp;n</code>, where we \"go to\" the address of <code>n</code> and print out the value of <code>n</code>, <code>50</code>.</p> <p>The <code>*</code> is known as the deference operator. It \"goes to the reference\" and access that data at that location, allowing you to manipulate it at will.</p> <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nint main(void)\n{\nint n = 50;\nprintf(\"%i\\n\", *&amp;n); // notice the *&amp;n here\n}\n</code></pre> <p>We also have to use the <code>*</code> operator (in an unfortunately confusing way) to declare a variable that we want to be a pointer:</p> <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nint main(void)\n{\nint n = 50;\nint *p = &amp;n; // declaring the pointer variable\nprintf(\"%p\\n\", p);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Here, we use int <code>*p</code> to declare a variable, <code>p</code>, that has the type of <code>*</code>, a pointer, to a value of type <code>int</code>, an integer. Then, we can print its value (something like <code>0x12345678</code>), or print the value at its location with <code>printf(\"%i\\n\", *p);</code>.</p> <p>In our computer\u2019s memory, the variables might look like this (each square representing a byte of memory):</p> <p></p> <p>We have a pointer, <code>p</code>, with the address of some variable.</p> <p>We can abstract away the actual value of the addresses now, since they\u2019ll be different as we declare variables in our programs, and simply think of <code>p</code> as \u201cpointing at\u201d some value:</p> <p></p> <p>An easier way to look at this is if we have a mailbox labeled \"123\", with the number \"50\" inside it. The mailbox would be <code>int n</code>, since it stores an integer. We might have another mailbox with the address \u201c456\u201d, inside of which is the value \u201c123\u201d, which is the address of our other mailbox. This would be <code>int *p</code>, since it\u2019s a pointer to an integer.

The value     following the first <code>case</code> is <code>'tomato'</code>.

Note: without     <code>break</code> keywords, the first matching case will run, but so will every other     subsequent case regardless of whether or not it matches - including the     default. This behavior is different from <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> conditional statements     that execute only one block of code.</p> </li> <li> <p>At the end of each <code>switch</code> statement, there is a <code>default</code> statement.

They make it really easy to write complex programs with lots and lots of instructions, and keep everything organized and straight. Often times when you're writing a program in JavaScript, there will be several pieces of data that you need to keep track of. Think for example of Facebook. Facebook keeps track of tons of information and displays it on their websites and apps. Things like names, birthdays, status', etc. In order for us to write more complex programs like these, that do more than print text out onto the screen, we'll need to learn how to manage all of the information in our programs and use variables.</p> <p>Variables are essentially containers which allow a program to store different pieces of information inside of them. Once the information is stored inside the variable, that information can then be accessed throughout the program simply by referring to the variable's name. Using variables is a great way to keep track of and organize your data. When creating variables, make sure to use descriptive names! For example, if we were creating a variable to hold someones age, using <code>var age</code> is much better than <code>var a</code>. This can save time trying to figure out what each variable is defining!</p> <p>Let's make some variables in JS:</p> <pre><code>var phrase = \"To be or not to be\";\n\ndocument.write(phrase);\n</code></pre> <p><code>var</code> is a special word in JS, which tells JS that a variable is being created. Now we can call the variable within the <code>document.write();</code> command instead of having to type out the string. This can be very powerful and save programmers a ton of time! We can also change the variable after defining it originally:</p> <pre><code>var phrase = \"To be or not to be\";\n\ndocument.write(phrase);\nphrase = \"Apple\";\ndocument.write(phrase);\n</code></pre> <p>Now it should print out <code>To be or not to be</code> and <code>apple</code>.</p> <p>We are not limited to only storing strings of text within a variable. We can also store numbers (whole numbers or decimals), boolean variables, undefined, and Null:</p> <pre><code>var name = \"Nick\";\nvar age = 25;\nvar gpa = 3.8;\nvar isMale = true;\nvar flaws = null;\nvar description = undefined;\n\ndocument.write(`${name} is ${age} years old.`);\nif ((isMale = true)) {\ndocument.write(`He has a ${gpa} GPA.`);\n} else {\ndocument.write(`She has a ${gpa} GPA.`);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The above code should have the following output:</p> <pre><code>Nick is 25 years old.He has a 3.8 GPA.\n</code></pre> <p><code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code> are different because when you use <code>null</code>, you are saying that there is no value, but <code>undefined</code> says that there is no value yet. You will probably not use <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code> much as a developer, but they are still good to know/understand.</p> <p>The <code>$</code> used above is called interpolation. This allows us to insert, or interpolate, variables into strings using template literals.</p> <p>Notice that:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A template literal is wrapped by backticks ``` (this key is usually located     on the top of your keyboard, left of the 1 key).</p> </li> <li> <p>Inside the template literal, you\u2019ll see a placeholder, <code>${myPet}</code>. The     value of <code>myPet</code> is inserted into the template literal.</p> </li> <li> <p>When we interpolate <code>I own a pet ${myPet}.</code>, the output we print is the     string: <code>'I own a pet armadillo.'</code></p> </li> </ul> <p>One of the biggest benefits to using template literals is the readability of the code. Using template literals, you can more easily tell what the new string will be. You also don't have to worry about escaping double quotes or single quotes.</p> <p>Remember to use descriptive variable names! Think of a variable as a moving box. When you fill up the box it is common to write on the outside of the box what it contains. Use similar logic when it comes to naming variables.</p>"},{"location":"js-data-types/#create-a-variable-let","title":"Create a Variable: <code>let</code>","text":"<p>The <code>let</code> keyword signlas that the variable can be reassigned a different value.

Without the curly braces, whatever the line evaluates will be automatically     returned. The contents of the block should immediately follow the arrow <code>=&gt;</code>     and the <code>return</code> keyword can be removed. This is referred to as implicit     return.</li> </ul> <pre><code>// Single-line Block\nconst sumNumbers = (number) =&gt; number + number;\n\n// Multi-line Block\nconst sumNumbers = (number) =&gt; {\nconst sum = number + number;\nreturn sum; // requires the return statement\n};\n</code></pre> <p>For example, if we have the following function:</p> <pre><code>const squareNum = (num) =&gt; {\nreturn num * num;\n};\n</code></pre> <p>We can refactor the function to:</p> <pre><code>const squareNum = (num) =&gt; num * num;\n</code></pre> <p>Notice the following changes:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The parentheses around <code>num</code> have been removed, since it has a single     parameter.</p> </li> <li> <p>The curly braces <code>{}</code> have been removed since the function consists of a     single-line block.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>return</code> keyword has been removed since the function consists of a     single-line block.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"js-functions/#rock-paper-scissors","title":"Rock, Paper, Scissors","text":"<pre><code>// Command Line Rock, Paper, Scissors game\n// User input is set in the playGame() function in the const userChoice\n\nconst getUserChoice = (userInput) =&gt; {\nuserInput = userInput.toLowerCase();\nif (\nuserInput === \"rock\" ||\nuserInput === \"paper\" ||\nuserInput === \"scissors\"\n) {\nreturn userInput;\n} else {\nconsole.log(\"Error!\");\n}\n};\n\nconst getComputerChoice = () =&gt; {\nrandomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);\nswitch (randomNumber) {\ncase 0:\nreturn \"rock\";\ncase 1:\nreturn \"paper\";\ncase 2:\nreturn \"scissors\";\n}\n};\n\nconst determineWinner = (userInput, computerChoice) =&gt; {\nif (userInput === computerChoice) {\nreturn \"The game is a tie!\";\n}\nif (userInput === \"rock\") {\nif (computerChoice === \"paper\") {\nreturn \"The computer won!\";\n} else {\nreturn \"You won!\";\n}\n}\nif (userInput === \"paper\") {\nif (computerChoice === \"scissors\") {\nreturn \"The computer won!\";\n} else {\nreturn \"You won!\";\n}\n}\nif (userInput === \"scissors\") {\nif (computerChoice === \"rock\") {\nreturn \"The computer won!\";\n} else {\nreturn \"You won!\";\n}\n}\n};\n\nconst playGame = () =&gt; {\nconst userChoice = getUserChoice(\"scissors\");\nconst computerChoice = getComputerChoice();\nconsole.log(\"You threw: \" + userChoice);\nconsole.log(\"The computer threw: \" + computerChoice);\nconsole.log(determineWinner(userChoice, computerChoice));\n};\n\nplayGame();\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"js-ho-functions/","title":"Higher-Order Functions","text":""},{"location":"js-ho-functions/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>We are often unaware of the number of assumptions we make when we communicate with other people in our native languages.

In OOP you write classes that represent real-world things and situations, and you create objects based on these classes. When you write a class, you define the general behavior that a whole category of objects can have. When you create individual objects from the class, each object is automatically equipped with the genearl behavior; you can then give each object whatever unique traits you desire. You'll be amazed how well real-world situations can be modeled with object-oriented programming.</p> <p>Making an object from a class is called instantiation, and you work with instances of a class. On this page, we'll write classes and create instances of those classes. We will specify the kind of information that will be stored in instances, and we'll define actions that can be taken with these instances. We'll also write classes that extend the functionality of existing classes, so similar classes can share code efficiently. We'll store our classes in modules and import classes written by other programmers into our program files.</p> <p>Understanding object-oriented programming will help us see the world as a programmer does. It'll help us really know our code, not just what's happening line by line, but also the bigger picture behind it.

Let's start by writing a simple class, <code>Dog</code>, that represents a dog - not one dog in particular, but any dog. What do we know about pet dogs? Well, they all have a name and age. We also know that most dogs sit and roll over. Those two pieces of information (name and age) and those two behaviors (sit and roll over) will go in our <code>Dog</code> class because they're common to most dogs. This class will tell Python how to make an object representing a dog. After our class is written, we'll use it to make individual instances, each of which represent one specific dog.</p>"},{"location":"py-classes/#creating-the-dog-class","title":"Creating the Dog Class","text":"<p>Each instance created from the <code>Dog</code> class will store a <code>name</code> and an <code>age</code>, and we'll give each dog the ability to <code>sit()</code> and <code>roll_over()</code>:</p> <pre><code>class Dog:\n\"\"\"A simple attempt to model a dog.\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, name, age):\n\"\"\"Initialized name and age attributes.\"\"\"\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n\n    def sit(self):\n\"\"\"Simulate a dog sitting in response to a command.\"\"\"\n        print(f\"{self.name} is now sitting.\")\n\n    def roll_over(self):\n\"\"\"Simulate rolling over in response to a command.\"\"\"\n        print(f\"{self.name} rolled over!\")\n</code></pre> <p>There's a lot to notice here, but don't worry.

By convention, capitalized names refer to classes in Python. There are no parenthesis in the class deinition because we're creating this class from scratch. On line 2, we write a docstring describing what this class does.</p>"},{"location":"py-classes/#the-__init__-method","title":"The <code>__init__()</code> Method","text":"<p>A function that's part of a class is a method. Everything you learned about functions applies to methods as well; the only practical difference for now is the way we'll call methods. The <code>__init__()</code> method on line 4 is a special method that Python runs automatically whenever we create a new instance based on the <code>Dog</code> class. This method has two leading underscores and two trailing underscores, a convention that helps prevent Python's default method names from conflicting with your method names. Make sure to use two underscores on each side of <code>__init__()</code>. If you use just one on each side, the method won't be called automatically when you use your class, which can result in errors that are difficult to identify.</p> <p>We define the <code>__init__()</code> method to have three parameters: <code>self</code>, <code>name</code>, and <code>age</code>. The <code>self</code> parameter is required in the method definition, and it must come first before the other parameters. It must be included in the definition because when Python cals this method later (to create an instance of <code>Dog</code>), the method call will automatically pass the <code>self</code> argument. Every method call associated with an instance automatically passes <code>self</code>, which is a reference to the instance itself; it gives the individual instance access to the attributes and methods in the class. When we make an instance of <code>Dog</code>, Python will call the <code>__init__()</code> method from the <code>Dog</code> class. We'll pass <code>Dog()</code> a name and an age as arguments; self is passed automatically, so we don't need to pass it. Whenever we want to make an instance from the <code>Dog</code> class, we'll provide values for only the last two parameters, <code>name</code> and <code>age</code>.</p> <p>The two variables defined on line 6/7 each have the prefix <code>self</code>. Any varibale prefixed with <code>self</code> is available to every method in the class, and we'll also be able to access these variables through any instance created from the class. The line <code>self.name = name</code> takes the value associated with the parameter <code>name</code> and assigns it to the variable <code>name</code>, which is then attached to the instance being created. The same process happens with <code>self.age = age</code>. Variables that are accessible through instances like this are called attributes.</p> <p>The <code>Dog</code> class has two other methods defined: <code>sit()</code> and <code>roll_over()</code> (line 9 &amp; 13). Because these methods don't need additional information to run, we just define them to have one parameter, <code>self</code>. The instances we create later will have access to these methods. In other words, they'll be able to sit and roll over. For now, <code>sit()</code> and <code>roll_over()</code> don't do much. They simply print a message saying the dog is sitting or rolling over. But the concept can be extended to realistic situations: if this class were part of an actual computer game, these messages would contain code to make an animated dog sit and roll over. If this class was written to control a robot, these methods would direct movements that cause a robotic doc to sit and roll over.</p>"},{"location":"py-classes/#making-an-instance-from-a-class","title":"Making an Instance from a Class","text":"<p>Think of a class as a set of instructions for how to make an instance.

How can you managae a fleet of aliens? One way is to make a list of aliens in which each alien is a dictionary of information about that alien. For example, the following code builds a list of three aliens:</p> <pre><code>alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}\nalien_1 = {'color': 'yellow', 'points': 10}\nalien_2 = {'color': 'red', 'points': 15}\n\naliens = [alien_0, alien_1, alien_2]\n\nfor alien in aliens:\n    print(alien)\n</code></pre> <p>We first create three dictionaries, each representing a different alien. On line 5 we store each of these dictionaries in a list called <code>aliens</code>. Finally, we loop through the list and print out each alien:</p> <pre><code>{'color': 'green', 'points': 5}\n{'color': 'yellow', 'points': 10}\n{'color': 'red', 'points': 15}\n</code></pre> <p>A more realistic example would involve more than three alies with code that automatically generates each alien. In the following example we use <code>range()</code> to create a fleet of 30 aliens:</p> <pre><code># Make an empty list for storing aliens\naliens = []\n\n# Make 30 green aliens.\nfor alien_number in range(30):\n    new_alien = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5, 'speed': 'slow'}\n    aliens.append(new_alien)\n\n# Show the first 5 aliens.\nfor alien in aliens[:5]:\n    print(alien)\nprint(\"...\")\n\n# Show how many aliens have been created.\nprint(f\"Total number of aliens: {len(aliens)}\")\n</code></pre> <p>This example befins with an empty list to hold all of the aliens that will created. At line 5 <code>range()</code> returns a series of numbers, which just tells Python how many times we want the loop to repeat. Each time the loop runs we create a new alien (line 6) and then append each new alien to the list <code>aliens</code> (line 7). On line 10 we us a slice to print the first five aliens, and then on line 15 we print the length of the list to prove we've actually generated the full fleet of 30 aliens:</p> <pre><code>{'color': 'green', 'points': 5, 'speed': 'slow'}\n{'color': 'green', 'points': 5, 'speed': 'slow'}\n{'color': 'green', 'points': 5, 'speed': 'slow'}\n{'color': 'green', 'points': 5, 'speed': 'slow'}\n{'color': 'green', 'points': 5, 'speed': 'slow'}\n...\nTotal number of aliens: 30\n</code></pre> <p>These aliens all have the same characteristics, but Python considers each one a separate object, which allows us to modify each alien individually.</p> <p>How might you work with a group of aliens like this? Imagine that one aspect of a game has some aliens changing color and moving faster as the game progress. When it's time to change colors, we can use a <code>for</code> loop and an <code>if</code> statement to change the color of the aliens. For example, to change the first three aliens to yellow, medium-speed aliens worth 10 points each, we could do this:</p> <pre><code># Make an empty list for storing aliens\naliens = []\n\n# Make 30 green aliens.\nfor alien_number in range(30):\n    new_alien = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5, 'speed': 'slow'}\n    aliens.append(new_alien)\n\nfor alien in aliens[:3]:\n    if alien['color'] == 'green':\n        alien['color'] = 'yellow'\n        alien['speed'] = 'medium'\n        alien['points'] = '10'\n\n# Show the first 5 aliens.\nfor alien in aliens[:5]:\n    print(alien)\nprint(\"...\")\n</code></pre> <p>Because we want to modify the first three aliens, we loop through a slice that includes only the first three aliens. All of the aliens are green now but that won't always be the case, so we write an <code>if</code> statement to make sure we're only modifying green aliens. If the alien is green, we change the color to <code>'yellow'</code>, the speed to <code>'medium'</code>, and the point value to <code>10</code>, as shown in the following output:</p> <pre><code>{'color': 'yellow', 'points': '10', 'speed': 'medium'}\n{'color': 'yellow', 'points': '10', 'speed': 'medium'}\n{'color': 'yellow', 'points': '10', 'speed': 'medium'}\n{'color': 'green', 'points': 5, 'speed': 'slow'}\n{'color': 'green', 'points': 5, 'speed': 'slow'}\n...\n</code></pre> <p>You could expand this loop by adding an <code>elif</code> block that turns yellow aliens into red, fast-moving ones worth 15 points each. Without showing the entire program again, that loop would look like this:</p> <pre><code>for alien in aliens[:3]:\n    if alien['color'] == 'green':\n        alien['color'] = 'yellow'\n        alien['speed'] = 'medium'\n        alien['points'] = '10'\n    elif alien['color'] == 'yellow':\n        alien['color'] = 'red'\n        alien['speed'] = 'fast'\n        alien['points'] = 15\n</code></pre> <p>It's common to store a number of dictionaries in a list when each dictionary contains many kinds of information about one subject. For example, you might create a dictionary for each user on a website and store the individual dictionaries in a list called <code>users</code>.

For example, consider how you might describe a pizza that someone is ordering. If you were to use only a list, all you could really store is a list of the pizza's toppings. With a dictionary, a list of toppings can be just one aspect of the pizza you're describing.</p> <p>In the following example, two kinds of information are stored for each pizza: a type of crust and a list of toppings. The list of toppings is a value associated with the key <code>'toppings'</code>. To use the items in the list, we give the name of the dictionary and the key <code>'toppings'</code>, as we would any value in the dictionary. Instead of returning a single value, we get a list of toppings:</p> <pre><code># Store information about a pizza being ordered.\npizza = {\n    'crust': 'thick',\n    'toppings': ['mushrooms', 'extra cheese'],\n}\n\n# Summarize the order.\nprint(f\"You ordered a {pizza['crust']}-crust pizza \"\n    \"with the following toppings:\")\n\nfor topping in pizza['toppings']:\n    print(\"\\t\" + topping)\n</code></pre> <p>We begin on line 2 with a dictionary that holds information about a pizza that has been ordered. One key in the dictionary is <code>'crust'</code>, and the associated value is the string <code>'thick'</code>. The next key, <code>'toppings'</code>, has a list as its value that stores all the requested toppings. On line 8 we summarize the order before building the pizza. When you need to break up a long ling in a <code>print()</code> call, choose an appropriate point at which to break the line being printed and quotation mark. Indent the next line, add an opening quotation mark, and continue the string. Python will automatically combine all of the strings it finds inside the parentheses. To print the toppings, we write a <code>for</code> loop on line 10. To access the list of toppings, we use the key <code>'toppings'</code>, and Python grabs the list of toppings from the dictionary.</p> <p>The following output summarizes the pizza that we plan to build:</p> <pre><code>You ordered a thick-crust pizza with the following toppings:\n    mushrooms\n    extra cheese\n</code></pre> <p>You can nest a list inside a dictionary any time you want more than one value to be associated with a single key in a dictionary. In the earlier example of favorite programming languages, if we were to store each person's responses in a list, people could choose more than one favorite language. When we loop through the dictionary, the value associated with each person would be a list of languages rather than a single language. Inside the dictionary's <code>for</code> loop, we use another <code>for</code> loop to run through the list of languages associated with each person:</p> <pre><code>favorite_languages = {\n    'jen': ['python', 'ruby'],\n    'sarah': ['c'],\n    'edward': ['ruby', 'go'],\n    'phil': ['python', 'haskell'],\n}\n\nfor name, languages in favorite_languages.items():\n    print(f\"\\n{name.title()}'s favorite languages are:\")\n    for language in languages:\n        print(f\"\\t{language.title()}\")\n</code></pre> <p>As you can see on line 1, the value associated with each name is now a list. Notice that some people have one favorite language and others have multiple favorites. When we loop through the dictionary on line 8, we use the variable name <code>languages</code> to hold each value from the dictionary, because we know that each value will be a list. Inside the main dictionary loop, we use another <code>for</code> loop (line 10) to run through each persons list of favorite languages.</p> <p>Now each person can list as many favorite languages as they like:</p> <pre><code>Jen's favorite languages are:\n    Python\n    Ruby\n\nSarah's favorite languages are:\n    C\n\nEdward's favorite languages are:\n    Ruby\n    Go\n\nPhil's favorite languages are:\n    Python\n    Haskell\n</code></pre> <p>To refine this program even further, you can ad an <code>if</code> statement at the beginning of the dictionary's <code>for</code> loop to see whether each person has more than one favorite language by examining the value of <code>len(languages)</code>. If a person has more than one favoriem the output would stay the same. If the person has only one favorite language, you could change the wording to reflect that.

We call <code>print_models()</code> and pass it the two lists it needs; as expected, <code>print_models()</code> simulates printing the designs. Then we call <code>show_completed_models()</code> and pass it the list of completed models so it can report the models that have been printed. The descriptive function names allow others to read this code and understand it, even without comments.</p> <p>This program is easier to extend and maintain than the version without functions. If we need to print more designs later on, we can simply call <code>print_models()</code> again. If we realize the printing code needs to be modified, we can change the code once, and our changes will take place everywhere the function is called. This technique is more efficient than having to update code separately in several places in the program.</p> <p>This example also demonstrates the idea that every function should have one specific job. The first function prints each design, and the second displays the completed models. This is more beneficial than using one function to do both jobs. If you're writing a function and notice the function is doing too many different tasks, try to split the code into two functions.

But how, exactly, does DNA profiling work? Given a sequence of DNA, how can forensic investigators identify to whom it belongs?</p> <p>Well, DNA is really just a sequence of molecules called nucleotides, arranged into a particular shape (a double helix). Each nucleotide of DNA contains one of four different bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or thymine (T). Every human cell has billions of these nucleotides arranged in sequence. Some portions of this sequence (i.e. genome) are the same, or at least very similar, across almost all humans, but other portions of the sequence have a higher genetic diversity and thus vary more across the population.</p> <p>One place where DNA tends to have high genetic diversity is in Short Tandem Repeats (STRs). An STR is a short sequence of DNA bases that tends to repeat consecutively numerous times at specific locations inside of a person\u2019s DNA. The number of times any particular STR repeats varies a lot among individuals. In the DNA samples below, for example, Alice has the STR <code>AGAT</code> repeated four times in her DNA, while Bob has the same STR repeated five times.</p> Alice: CT AGAT AGAT AGAT AGAT GACT A Bob: CT AGAT AGAT AGAT AGAT AGAT T <p>Using multiple STRs, rather than just one, can improve the accuracy of DNA profiling. If the probability that two people have the same number of repeats for a single STR is 5%, and the analyst looks at 10 different STRs, then the probability that two DNA samples match purely by chance is about 1 in 1 quadrillion (assuming all STRs are independent of each other). So if two DNA samples match in the number of repeats for each of the STRs, the analyst can be pretty confident they came from the same person. CODIS, The FBI\u2019s DNA database, uses 20 different STRs as part of its DNA profiling process.</p> <p>What might such a DNA database look like? Well, in its simplest form, you could imagine formatting a DNA database as a CSV file, wherein each row corresponds to an individual, and each column corresponds to a particular STR.</p> <pre><code>name,AGAT,AATG,TATC\nAlice,28,42,14\nBob,17,22,19\nCharlie,36,18,25\n</code></pre> <p>The data in the above file would suggest that Alice has the sequence <code>AGAT</code> repeated 28 times consecutively somewhere in her DNA, the sequence <code>AATG</code> repeated 42 times, and <code>TATC</code> repeated 14 times. Bob, meanwhile, has those same three STRs repeated 17 times, 22 times, and 19 times, respectively. And Charlie has those same three STRs repeated 36, 18, and 25 times, respectively.</p> <p>So given a sequence of DNA, how might you identify to whom it belongs? Well, imagine that you looked through the DNA sequence for the longest consecutive sequence of repeated <code>AGAT</code>s and found that the longest sequence was 17 repeats long. If you then found that the longest sequence of <code>AATG</code> is 22 repeats long, and the longest sequence of <code>TATC</code> is 19 repeats long, that would provide pretty good evidence that the DNA was Bob\u2019s. Of course, it\u2019s also possible that once you take the counts for each of the STRs, it doesn\u2019t match anyone in your DNA database, in which case you have no match.</p> <p>In practice, since analysts know on which chromosome and at which location in the DNA an STR will be found, they can localize their search to just a narrow section of DNA.

When the player runs out of ships, their time runs out, or the cities they were supposed to protect are all destroyed, the game should end. It needs to end if any one of these event happen. If many possible events might occur to stop the program, trying to test all these conditions in one <code>while</code> statement becomes complicated and difficult.</p> <p>For a program that should run only as long as many conditions are true, you can define one variable that determines whether or not the entire program is active. This varibale, called a flag, acts as a signal to the program. We can write our programs so they run while the flag is set to <code>True</code> and stop running when any of several events sets the value of the flag to <code>False</code>. As a result, our overall <code>while</code> statement needs to check only one condition: whether or not the flag is currently <code>True</code>. Then, all our other tests (to see if an event has occurred that should set the flag to <code>False</code>) can be neatly organized in the rest of the program.</p> <p>Let's add a flag to the program from the previous section.

As long as the <code>active</code> variable remains <code>True</code>, the loop will continue running (line 5).</p> <p>In the <code>if</code> statement inside the <code>while</code> loop, we check the value of <code>message</code> once the user enters their input.

If the user enters anything other than <code>'quit'</code>, we print the input as a message.</p> <p>This program has the same output as the previous example where we placed the conditional test directly in the <code>while</code> statement. But now that we have a flag to indicate whether the overal program is in an active state, it would be easy to add more tests (such as <code>elif</code> statements) for events that should cause <code>active</code> to become <code>False</code>. This is useful in complicated programs like games in which there may be many evenet that should each make the program stop running.

Next, we tell Python to loop through each value from 1 to 10 using the <code>range()</code> function. Inside the loop, the current value is raised to the second power and assigned to the variable <code>square</code>. Finally, when the loop has finished running, the list of squares is printed:</p> <pre><code>[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]\n</code></pre> <p>To write this code even more precisely, omit the temporary variable <code>square</code> and append each new value directly to the list:</p> <pre><code>squares = []\nfor value in range(1, 11):\n    squares.append(value**2)\nprint(squares)\n</code></pre> <p>Sometimes using a temporary value makes our code easier to read; other times it makes the code unecessarily long.</p>"},{"location":"py-working-with-lists/#simple-statistics-with-a-list-of-numbers","title":"Simple Statistics with a List of Numbers","text":"<p>A few Python functions are helpful when working with lists of numbers.
